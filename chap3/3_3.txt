3.3 REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS

3.3.1 Stakeholder Analysis and User Personas

The main stakeholders for the Verdex system include end users (students, botanists, hobbyists), administrators, and system developers. User personas were developed to represent typical users, such as a student needing quick plant identification, a botanist requiring detailed species data, and an admin managing content and user feedback.

3.3.2 Functional Requirements Specification

The system was required to provide multilingual plant identification, offline functionality, user authentication, plant database management, and feedback collection. Users can register, log in, identify plants using images, view plant details in multiple languages, save favorites, and submit feedback. Administrators can manage plant data, translations, categories, and review user feedback.

3.3.2.1 User Authentication and Authorization Requirements

Secure registration, login, password reset, and role-based access control were implemented. Only authorized users can access certain features, and admins have elevated privileges.

3.3.2.2 Plant Identification and ML Processing Requirements

Users can upload or capture plant images for identification. The system processes images using an on-device machine learning model and returns results instantly, even offline.

3.3.2.3 Multilingual Content Management Requirements

Plant information, including names and descriptions, is available in multiple languages. The system supports easy addition of new languages and translations.

3.3.2.4 Offline Functionality Requirements

Core features, such as plant identification and viewing saved data, are available without internet access. Data synchronization occurs when connectivity is restored.

3.3.2.5 Admin Dashboard and Content Management Requirements

Admins can add, edit, or remove plant entries, manage translations, upload images and audio, and review user feedback through a web-based dashboard.

3.3.3 Non-Functional Requirements Specification

The system was designed for high performance, reliability, security, usability, and scalability. It supports fast response times, secure data handling, intuitive interfaces, and can accommodate future growth.

3.3.4 System Constraints and Limitations

Constraints include device storage limits, model size for on-device inference, and the need for periodic updates to plant data and translations.

3.3.5 Requirements Validation and Verification

Requirements were validated through stakeholder feedback, user testing, and iterative reviews. Verification was achieved via test cases, acceptance criteria, and system demonstrations.
