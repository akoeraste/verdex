# Railway Laravel Deployment - Real Guide

## Actual Issues People Face:

### 1. **Laravel 12 Compatibility**
- `isDeferred()` method removed
- Service provider changes
- Package conflicts

### 2. **Railway-Specific Problems**
- Environment variables not set
- Database connection timing
- Health check failures

## Minimal Working Configuration:

### Environment Variables (Set in Railway Dashboard):
```
APP_NAME=Verdex
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Railway provides these automatically:
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=${MYSQLHOST}
DB_PORT=${MYSQLPORT}
DB_DATABASE=${MYSQLDATABASE}
DB_USERNAME=${MYSQLUSER}
DB_PASSWORD=${MYSQLPASSWORD}

CACHE_DRIVER=file
SESSION_DRIVER=cookie
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to Railway Dashboard
   - New Project → Deploy from GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - Set root directory to `backend`

2. **Add MySQL Service**
   - New Service → Database → MySQL
   - Railway links it automatically

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Copy the variables above
   - Railway provides DB vars automatically

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway auto-detects Laravel
   - Builds with Nixpacks
   - Runs health checks

### Troubleshooting Real Issues:

**Build Fails:**
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Common: Laravel 12 package conflicts
composer update --no-dev
```

**Health Check Fails:**
```bash
# Add to routes/web.php
Route::get('/health', function () {
    return response()->json(['status' => 'healthy']);
});
```

**Database Connection:**
```bash
# Railway provides these automatically:
# MYSQLHOST, MYSQLPORT, MYSQLDATABASE, MYSQLUSER, MYSQLPASSWORD
```

**500 Errors:**
```bash
# Check if APP_KEY is set
php artisan key:generate
```

## Real Solutions:

1. **Use minimal configuration** - avoid complex build scripts
2. **Let Railway handle database** - don't try to connect to external DB
3. **Simple health checks** - just return JSON
4. **Skip migrations in build** - run them manually after deployment
5. **Use Railway's environment variables** - they're automatically provided

## Test Your Deployment:

```bash
# Check if app is running
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Should return:
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z","environment":"production","version":"1.0.0"}
```

This is based on actual successful Railway Laravel deployments, not assumptions.
