# Backend Test Report

## Summary

- **Unit Tests:** All unit tests passed after fixing model relationships and factories.
- **Feature Tests:** Many feature tests failed due to mismatches between test expectations and actual API responses, as well as some missing or mismatched fields in factories and test payloads.

## Unit Test Results
- All unit tests for models (User, Plant, etc.) passed successfully.

## Feature Test Results
- **AuthControllerTest:**
  - Registration, login, and logout tests mostly pass, but some fail due to missing or unexpected fields (e.g., `language_preference`).
- **FavoriteControllerTest:**
  - Most tests fail due to response structure mismatches (e.g., expecting `data` key, but API returns a different structure or status code).
- **FeedbackControllerTest:**
  - Some tests fail due to response structure mismatches and missing required fields or columns.
- **PlantControllerTest:**
  - Many tests fail due to validation errors (e.g., missing required translations) or response structure mismatches.

## Main Reasons for Feature Test Failures
- **API response structure does not match test expectations.**
- **Factories and test payloads do not always match the actual database schema or validation rules.**
- **Some endpoints require additional data (e.g., translations for plants) that tests do not provide.**
- **Some tests expect certain status codes (e.g., 201, 422, 404) but the API returns different codes.**

## Recommendations
1. **Align test payloads and factories with actual validation rules and database schema.**
2. **Update feature tests to match the actual API response structure.**
3. **Review controller validation and response logic to ensure consistency and clarity.**
4. **Add missing fields to factories and test payloads as required by validation rules.**
5. **Consider adding more detailed error handling and consistent response formats in controllers.**

## Next Steps
- Review and update failing feature tests and/or API endpoints for consistency.
- Re-run the test suite after making adjustments.
